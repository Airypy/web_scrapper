 What is Love? - 12 July 2012 - QA 3
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
The basis of all existence. All the cells in your body love each other, that is why they are together. The day they stop loving each other, it all disintegrates. Got it?
If there is one substances by which everything is held together and you want to give it a name, you can call it love. It is the basis of all existence. All the cells in your body love each other, that is why they are together. The day they stop loving each other, it all disintegrates.
Love is not all wiggly wiggly and mushy mushy, ""Oh I can’t live without you, I love you so much"", and so on. It is not that. That is just an emotional something. Love means (silence)… that is it.
Love is indescribable. You can’t describe it. And there is not a creature on this planet who doesn’t know it. From the insect to the lion, from a chicken to an enlightened person, everybody has experienced love. Love for life is what we think it is, but life itself is love. So see, through this knowledge, that the whole universe is love.
Love is not just an emotion, it is your very existence. The earth loves the sun, that is why it keeps going around the sun. The moon loves the earth, that is why the moon goes around the earth. Wherever there is a force, or there is energy, or a pull, or attraction, you call it love. And where there is repulsion that is also love in the opposite direction.
Why are you are drawn to somebody or something? It is because you love them. You see a cheesecake and you are drawn to it; you experience a pull, isn't it? You see a beautiful girl, or a girl sees a beautiful boy, there is a pull, and what do you call that? You call it love! Why? Because there is a pull, there is an attraction, there is a force. And that force is what manages the whole universe
Some places it is more obvious and some other places it is not obvious. The day the earth stops loving you, you will start flying. The earth loves you so much that the gravitational force keeps you glued to the earth. So love is that force in human life.
All the negative emotions are just a distorted form of love. In anger there is love. Ask me how? You love perfection and that is why you get angry. Greed is love. Greed is when you love something much more than life. When you love objects more than life, it is called greed. Hatred is love upside down. Fear is love upside down.

"Q: 

 I think I am addicted to sex. I have no self-control when it comes to sex. I try very hard, but I can’t control myself.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
I think you have too much free time. If you are busy and you work hard, then you will get so tired that you will be waiting to hit the pillow. The moment you hit the pillow you will fall asleep. You either have too much free time or you are eating too much food; then obsessions and addictions come up. Too much food and sex are related. So, keep a watch on your food, keep a watch on your company and keep yourself very busy, especially at the age when the hormones play havoc. If you follow the language of moderation then you will be all right.   When you have a goal, or something to achieve, then you do not think about sex. Just ask any student, during exam time are they bombarded with thoughts of sex? They’ll say no. For that whole month when they have to achieve something, their mind is fully focused on it. They have a bundle of books to read and to prepare. So engaging yourself in some creative activity is helpful.  Pleasure always makes you run towards it first, and then later on makes you run away from it. This is its nature. First you crave for it and you go towards it, and then later on you go away from it because it becomes too much to handle. Yoga is that which makes you centered, it stabilizes you. When you are stable and centered, if pleasure is there, you enjoy it, if it’s not there, you don’t mind it. It does not occupy your mind. It’s not a craving that bothers you.

"Q: 

 Is it okay to see someone's beauty? Is it not lust to look at someone's beauty?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
If you see some beauty and you want to possess it, then it is lust. You see beautiful things in the world, and every beautiful thing should remind you of the divinity. Then the beauty itself becomes a prayer. A great saint from India wrote some beautiful verses in Sanskrit called Soundarya Lahari. In that he says thateverything he sees reminds him of the Divine. The waves of beauty, it all reminds him of the divinity.
"
"Q: 

 How do I know if I am deeply in love with a person or if it is just an attraction?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Time will tell. Always know that there is a sense of sacrifice in love, while attachment only brings misery. In the name of love, if you fall into an infatuation or attachment, then you will only get misery. But in true love, even sacrifice brings contentment. Love brings sacrifice and contentment, while attachment and feverishness can only bring misery.

 How to be in a relationship without depending on the other, and without feeling possessive?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Know that love is your nature and relax. By your very nature you are loving. Give the person whom you love their freedom, their space. When you love somebody, you almost want to suffocate them. You want to police them from morning till night. It may sound very difficult to not do this, but that is the wisest thing to do. Don’t police the person you love a lot.

"
"Q: 

 How do we deal with the anger I have towards my spouse, especially when we both are at completely different frequencies?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
First realize you are magnanimous. If you believe in your magnanimity and your inner beauty, it will become easier for you to handle all such situations. When you don’t look within, when you are simply focusing on the behavior of others, it will definitely rattle your mind. Then you try to correct the other person and you will be unsuccessful.  People who irritate you, in some way or the other can bring about the best in you. They can bring out the talents and skills in you. See, when everyone around you is wonderful you don’t need any skill to handle a situation. It will only happen when there are people whom you think are unreasonable. So take it as an exercise as much as possible. I know it is not an easy job, but at least you save your mind.
"
"Q: 

 My wife always complains that I do not tell her ‘I love you’. But it is not in my nature to express love through words. Is it necessary to express love?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 See, there are different ways of saying and expressing love. Just find a way that suits you and say it. If you cannot say it in words, then express it by making some hand gestures. Or you can write it and give it to her. You can send her a text message. Nowadays you do not even have to write complete words in the text message. Just sending those emoticons does the job! So just send those to her, one in the morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening.  See, it is our duty to try and keep everyone happy. Whether they choose to be happy or not is up to them. Some people will not believe it, even if you express. After receiving your text they might ask, ""Do you really mean what you sent?"" The mind is really very mysterious. Love is said to be Anirvachaniya (that which is beyond words, or cannot be expressed completely through words). You go ahead and do it!
"
"Q: 

 Isn't sex created by God?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
God has put these tendencies in our lives for us to rise above them. Without this there is nothing else in life to do. We have also been given the wisdom and the tools to rise above them. So the solution has been given first and then the problem. We need to fit the right solution to the problem. If we don’t see the solution but remain caught up in the problem, then that is ignorance.
"
"Q: 

 Is there true love in this world? Most of the times love seems to be conditional, or out of convenience.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Do you love others unconditionally? Ask yourself this! Do not judge other people’s love for you. Suppose you find that someone’s love for you is conditional, don’t ask them, “Do you really love me? How much do you love me? Will you continue to love me all your life?”  Don’t ask these silly questions. Take it for granted that the other person loves you. If you find that their love is a little less, ask them, “Why do you love me so much?” instead of saying ""You don’t love me"".  Demand destroys love, so you should not demand love. Whether it is father-son, mother-daughter, husband-wife, wherever the demand comes, love starts reducing. So from your side, you be unconditional to your partner or your parents and say, “I am here for you. What is it that you want, I am here”.
"
"Q: 

 You have told us how to be in a relationship. Please tell us, how to come out of the relationship?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
You have already come out of it! When you want to come out of it, it is already done, isn't it? The main thing is to relate yourself to the divinity. If you have a relationship with the divine, you have a relationship with everyone. Then the question of establishing or breaking a relationship with anyone does not arise.     In attempting to break also, one may get stuck badly. The more the mind tries to break away the more it gets pulled towards the relationship, and experiences pain. You neither want to stay nor leave. In leaving one feels as though some comfort is being lost, and in staying, the pain gets too intense and it is hard to stay on. So it is better to secure a relationship with the divine. This way, relationships with everyone else are automatically established.
"
"Q: 

 Can you speak a little on marriage?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Marriage is a commitment to share one's life and care for another. It helps one to come out of self-centeredness. In a marriage, you cannot always think about only yourself. After being married you have to also think about your spouse. If you want to go on a vacation, you cannot just wander around, you have to consult your better half, and all decisions need to be taken in consultation with one another.  Marriage is a very sacred institution where you tell your partner, ""All my desires I give to you and I take all your desires"". So each one has the responsibility to fulfill the other's desires and not their own. Growing in marriage is growing in responsibility, and love and responsibility go together.  Marriage is also that institution of commitment to serve the society together. If you are married only to serve yourself, then you start demanding from each other, and demand destroys love. If you both have a goal to serve society, to make a difference in the world, then it is like two parallel lines that can move together till infinity. Then, there is satisfaction; life finds a fulfillment.

"
"Q: 

 How do I know that I am in love, what are the signs?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 When you love someone you don't see anything wrong with them. Even if you see some fault in them, you justify the fault and say, ""Well, everyone does it! It is normal"".  Then you think you have not done enough for them. The more you do, the more you want to do for them. And they are always on your mind. You want to see them happy, you want them to have the best, and you get hurt even over small things. Ordinary things become extraordinary when you are in love.
"
"Q: 

 Why do relationships take away our freedom?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
If there is wisdom in relationships, it does not take away freedom. If there is no wisdom, then there is no freedom. It is not the relationship that gives or takes away your freedom, it is lack of wisdom.

 How to cope with children’s expectations when they compare themselves with others and demand the things that others have?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
You have to tell children that you can only give them this much and they shouldn’t compare themselves with others.  It is important that you don’t give them any false hope. At the same time, we can give them a dream. If you pass or do this, maybe you will get it. Here lies the importance of bringing them up with that sensitivity and belongingness. That is why I say, make your children participate in your life instead of teaching them, then they will not even ask you. They should be a participant in your life, then they will be sensitive towards you, rather than putting a demand on you.    Before you become a good father or mother, you need to become a good uncle or aunt. You should communicate more with the friends of your children. They will listen to you. Suppose, if your son or daughter’s friends have any wrong habit, you can influence them to change. They will listen to you more than their own parents.

 I am scared of commitment. How do I get over that?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 If someone tells you, ""I will take you to a movie tomorrow"", and you wait for them at the movie theater and they don't show up, how would you feel. Just put yourself in the receiver’s chair, and then you will see how important it is to be committed.  A commitment can only be felt when it oversteps convenience. That which is convenient is not commitment. Often, what is convenient does not bring comfort, but gives an illusion of comfort. Also if you are too stuck in commitment, and it is very inconvenient, you are be unable to fulfill your commitment and will feel frustrated. Wisdom is to strike a balance between convenience and commitment.

"Q: 

 How to treat a cheating spouse. Do I ignore and wait till they do this again or leave them?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Well, first of all, don’t label them as a cheating spouse, know they are your spouse. If they have cheated in the past, they have done it out of some temptation, some ignorance, or some situation you don’t know what. But, with your love and compassion, with your love and support you can change them, and make them become more sincere.  If there is ever a competition between truth and love, it is love that will win. Truth will fail. Why does someone lie to you? It is because they feel that by telling the truth they may lose your love. A husband tells lies to his wife because he doesn’t want to lose the love of his wife. So love is more important than truth and that is why lies come.   If you give your spouse the assurance that no matter what the thing is, if they tell the truth, your love will never go down or you will not stop loving them, then they will never lie to you. They will come and confess every mistake and everything they do to you.   In ancient days this is what they used to do, because divorce was a remote possibility. People never used to divorce each other, so husbands would come and confess to the wives all the mistakes they made. The thinking was – “anyways she is not going to leave, she is going to be with him, so might as well tell her everything and keep my mind clear and feel free”. This is what people used to do if at all they committed any mistakes, or any adultery.   The main issue is -- do you have that power, that love to transform him or her? Do you have that patience to accommodate them, understand where they come from instead of just accusing them, pointing a finger at them, look you have cheated? If someone is cheating why are they doing that? Like a mother, if your son or daughter is making a mistake, don’t you go into the root of it, ""What made my son do this?” You don’t just accuse them and push them out, you go into the reason, the cause of why your child is doing that. You have to treat your spouse also like a child. Here in the west, mothering means showing authority, but mothering is a very positive term in the east. Mothering means not only as a companion but also a protector, one who takes care in all ways.

"Q: 

 I got divorced four years ago and got remarried less than a year ago. I see that the same situations are repeating in my life. Is this karma or am I not able to apply the knowledge?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
You will know this better. See what mistakes you are making. Do you have acceptance? Do you serve a person? Why would someone not like to be with you if you are a fountain of joy and enthusiasm? Why would someone not like to be with you if you are full of love and service, if you are hollow and empty, if you are in wisdom and knowledge? Everyone will want to spend time with you. So keep yourself soaked in wisdom day and night.

"Q: 

 How to build a real, pure relationship?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Best not to try to build a relationship, just be yourself; be natural and be simple and a relationship will develop naturally.If you try to build a relationship, that is when you become a little artificial. Then your behavior becomes artificial, not natural. Just imagine someone is trying to impress you, don’t you notice that? If someone is trying to impress you, what do you do? You move away. What you like, that is what others like as well. You like someone to be very honest, open, natural, unassuming with you, correct? That is exactly what the other also wants from you. Don’t try hard to impress your girlfriend or boyfriend. Best is to be yourself, be forgiving and be in the present moment.

"Q: 

 How to face Rahu and Shani Mahadasha (astrological planetary positions that bring forth a very hard phase of time)?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Don’t think that Rahu Dasha or Shani Dasha are bad. If you are on the spiritual path, and if you practice meditation, all these Dashas will do only good things to you.  People think the Shani Dasha is very bad. Shani Dasha pushes you towards the spiritual path. If you are stuck in small things, it relieves you from there and puts you on the spiritual path. If you are already in knowledge and wisdom, Shani Dasha doesn't do anything wrong.  In life, there are ups and down. Some good thing happens. Something which you don't like happens. But every incident is an opportunity for you to grow stronger. So, don't worry about Rahu Dasha or Shani Dasha.
"
"Q: 

 Sometimes I feel very lonely. I really don’t know what to do to get rid of this. I need someone to support me and someone on whom I can rely on.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Any companionship when it goes from a place of wanting or lack to contributing, it is long lasting. You came into this world all alone. Even if you are born twins, you are alone. When you go from here, you are going to go alone. Do not try to run away from loneliness. It is a blessing in disguise.  'This is the time for you to be centered. Push away everything around you. You will find that you are the scintillating energy of the universe. You are the centre of the consciousness. You are the ultimate truth. And this loneliness is only one step away from realizing that. Loneliness exists because you want to grab something from outside.  Lord Krishna in Gita has said, 'Anityam asukham lokam imam prapya bhajasva mam'.  He is saying, 'This world is impermanent and there is no fun in it; there is no joy in it. Look up to me, merge in me. Put your attention onto me'. It is time for you to do this. Trying to fill your loneliness by looking for a companion or anything outside is not going to work. Know that you are in this planet to give something and then pack up and leave. That is it. You have come here to give something. Take nothing from here.     I am not against you having a relationship or a family, or getting married. You can have your spouse or your companion, but not from the space of wanting something from them. You can imagine a partnership where you are content and you are only contributing to the other person. Such a relationship will last longer. When you feel lonely, sit and meditate. Listen to bhajans or songs. Your beloved is within you. You just have to look inwards. Once you find the beloved within you, then you will find him/her everywhere in creation.
"
"Q: 

 I have come to know that sex is not good. How do I get over my desire to have sex?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Why do you think sex is negative? Through sex alone everybody has come to this earth., In the past people have been made to believe “Sex is the original sin”. Sex is not a sin, it is a basic function. Any plant, human, animal, everything comes out of it, and it is okay in moderation. Nothing should be done in extremes. All that we need to know is that there is a difference between bliss and sex. Sex is energy draining and bliss is energy conserving. One is energy consuming, the other is energy conserving. That is the thing.

"
"Q: 

 I am not sure if I am with the right partner. I am getting bored in the relationship. What do I do?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
See, if your relationship is based on personal need, it may not last long. Once the need is fulfilled, on a physical level or on an emotional level, the mind will look for something else and go somewhere else. If your relationship is from the level of sharing, then it can last longer.  When you are looking for security, love and comfort from your partner, you become weak. All the negative emotions come up and you become demanding, and demand destroys love. If we just know this one thing, we could save our love from getting rotten.

 Please give guidance on parenting special children.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
You simply serve them. Don’t pity them. You know, people with special needs, their soul is in a different state. They are not in a sorry state. They have come to this planet just to take service. With this attitude, you do service. Never have sympathy for them, ‘Oh poor child’. Children with special needs have come just to take service from you.

"
"Q: 

 Please talk on the subject of divorce. When is it a good thing? Or is it always to be avoided?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 You should ask yourself, “Have you put your 100% to make the marriage work? Have you done all that you could to please your spouse and make them happy, and still it has not worked?”   Marriage means sacrifice. Sacrificing your desires for the good of the other and for the sake of the whole family. If you only keep thinking about your own wants then no marriage will work. You should see what “we” want. How “we” can progress and bring happiness to the family. Only if you keep your attention on that, will the marriage be successful.  So if you have done your 100% and still it doesn’t work, and you find that you are totally incompatible, then instead of being in hell and both suffering, with a good understanding you say, ""We cannot get along so you walk your way and I walk my way. Let’s be friends and be happy"".     So, one must part with this understanding. There is no point in living in a furnace all day and all night. But not like this gentleman who said that they had been married for forty years and suddenly after forty years, they realized that they we were never compatible. He is already seventy years old, and has been married for forty years and now he says, ""We were never compatible.”   Never mind, bear it for another five to ten years. Anyway, they say marriages are made in heaven, so when you go up there, you can resolve it.

"Q: 

 I could not marry the person I was in love with because of certain circumstances. Now I am not able to give all of my love to the person I am married to. How do I fix this struggle?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Look, you have made this relationship, so now give your 100% and see. Otherwise you will only keep dreaming. If a husband thinks that 'I did not get the kind of wife I wanted', and the wife thinks that 'I didn’t get the kind of husband I wanted', then both are going in different directions. This one relationship alone is not life; besides this there is so much to do in this world. So settle this one issue completely and move on.   You should think what I can do for this world, what I can do for the people around me, how much knowledge can I attain, and how much love can I give to others, instead of getting stuck from one relationship to another. You didn’t like one relationship so you went to the second one, then third one. There is no point in being a rolling stone. There is nothing called a perfect match. Whatever match you have gotten, you should be happy and move on with it. One area of your life is settled, so now move forward. No point of jumping from one relationship to another.   An elderly lady is Canada once said to me, ""Gurudev, you know that my husband is a very tough man and I have to manage him. I thought I would leave, but then I thought, if I don’t know how to row one boat then I cannot row the other boat as well. So, if you don’t know how to row one boat, changing the boat is not going to help you.

"Q: 

 I want to be honest with my parents about my sexuality. Yet my fear of losing their love and support has been stopping me from being honest with them. Please guide me to a solution.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 What are you going to achieve by telling your parents? Is it going to make them any happier? When they are not going to be happy, what is the point in telling them? Think about it. You don’t have to pretend to be what you are not; at the same time you don’t have to put a bomb where people cannot accept it. You could tell them gradually; prepare them in some way.  You have to study the situation. How fragile are your parents? How unhappy they will become by your saying that? Is it worth being that honest to them if this is going to make them miserable? You need to judge all these pros and cons.  In the ancient days, they used to say, ""Speak the truth but speak the pleasant truth. Don’t speak unpleasant truth and don’t speak pleasant lies"". This is the perfect balance.  So use your sense of discrimination and gently prepare them if you want to tell them, if it’s going to serve some purpose.

"Q: 

 Can you speak a little on marriage?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Marriage is a commitment to share one's life and care for another. It helps one to come out of self-centeredness. In a marriage, you cannot always think about only yourself. After being married you have to also think about your spouse. If you want to go on a vacation, you cannot just wander around, you have to consult your better half, and all decisions need to be taken in consultation with one another.  Marriage is a very sacred institution where you tell your partner, ""All my desires I give to you and I take all your desires"". So each one has the responsibility to fulfill the other's desires and not their own. Growing in marriage is growing in responsibility, and love and responsibility go together.  Marriage is also that institution of commitment to serve the society together. If you are married only to serve yourself, then you start demanding from each other, and demand destroys love. If you both have a goal to serve society, to make a difference in the world, then it is like two parallel lines that can move together till infinity. Then, there is satisfaction; life finds a fulfillment.
"
"Q: 

 How do I satisfy my loved ones that are very demanding? I feel like I have no freedom.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Sometimes, it is okay to be little insensitive. When the demands are not justified or not logical, you do not have to feel obliged by those demands, but you don't have to get upset either.  Suppose you are not a doctor and someone is demanding, ""Give me medicine""; will you get upset? No! You will just smile and say, ""Well, I am sorry, I am not a doctor, I can't treat you"". Now if they get upset then it is not your problem!  Find inner strength. Once you find your inner strength, nobody can take away your peace. And when you are centered, you are able to manage any situation, however complex however demanding.
"
"Q: 

 How to keep on loving without expecting. How is it possible? In love expectations arise, and if not fulfilled, it hurts.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Yes, you will have to go through these gymnastics. If you have wisdom, you don’t have to go through the pain to learn. When there is lack of wisdom, you go through pain, but you will come out of it in sometime, don’t worry.  This is why it is important for one to have a larger context to life. When you have a larger context, all these trivial things don’t really bother you. They are all like waves on the surface of the ocean, they rise and fall. So, have a bigger context to life; that is the knowledge of the self.  When you go deeper into the self, you realize that nothing can shake you because you are much bigger than your emotions, your situations and the people around you. Their praise and their blame don’t matter because you are much bigger than all this! Self knowledge uplifts you. With self knowledge you do not drown in the ocean of emotions and hurt.
"
"Q: 

 I am scared of commitment. How do I get over that?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 If someone tells you, ""I will take you to a movie tomorrow"", and you wait for them at the movie theater and they don't show up, how would you feel. Just put yourself in the receiver’s chair, and then you will see how important it is to be committed.  A commitment can only be felt when it oversteps convenience. That which is convenient is not commitment. Often, what is convenient does not bring comfort, but gives an illusion of comfort. Also if you are too stuck in commitment, and it is very inconvenient, you are be unable to fulfill your commitment and will feel frustrated. Wisdom is to strike a balance between convenience and commitment.
"
"Q: 

 I think I am addicted to sex. I have no self-control when it comes to sex. I try very hard, but I can’t control myself.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
I think you have too much free time. If you are busy and you work hard, then you will get so tired that you will be waiting to hit the pillow. The moment you hit the pillow you will fall asleep. You either have too much free time or you are eating too much food; then obsessions and addictions come up. Too much food and sex are related. So, keep a watch on your food, keep a watch on your company and keep yourself very busy, especially at the age when the hormones play havoc. If you follow the language of moderation then you will be all right.   When you have a goal, or something to achieve, then you do not think about sex. Just ask any student, during exam time are they bombarded with thoughts of sex? They’ll say no. For that whole month when they have to achieve something, their mind is fully focused on it. They have a bundle of books to read and to prepare. So engaging yourself in some creative activity is helpful.  Pleasure always makes you run towards it first, and then later on makes you run away from it. This is its nature. First you crave for it and you go towards it, and then later on you go away from it because it becomes too much to handle. Yoga is that which makes you centered, it stabilizes you. When you are stable and centered, if pleasure is there, you enjoy it, if it’s not there, you don’t mind it. It does not occupy your mind. It’s not a craving that bothers you.
"
"Q: 

 Please give guidance on parenting special children.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
You simply serve them. Don’t pity them. You know, people with special needs, their soul is in a different state. They are not in a sorry state. They have come to this planet just to take service. With this attitude, you do service. Never have sympathy for them, ‘Oh poor child’. Children with special needs have come just to take service from you.
"
"Q: 

 Is being gay an impression of the mind?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
It could be, or it could also be biological.  My advice would be to get out of labelling yourself based on some tendency of the body. Know that you are consciousness, you are love, you are scintillating energy. Your identification as energy, as love and as a beautiful person is far better than identifying yourself with the physical tendencies that may arise in you.   The spirit has no gender, it is beyond gender. The spirit is love, and that is what you are. When you know this, you become very solid.
"
"Q: 

 How do I deal with the rebelliousness of my kids?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Negative suggestions call for rebelliousness in the mind. If you say, “Don't do it”, then the mind says, “Why? Let me do it!” The mind calls for rebelliousness. But if you say, “You can do it, only you won't get the results”, then you don't leave a chance for the mind to be rebellious, then it takes the knowledge in.  I remember one dentist would tell kids who would ask ‘Why should I brush my teeth’, he would say, “No, you don't need to brush the teeth that you don't want, you only brush the teeth that you want to keep!”  So, move from negative suggestions to positive ones, this is important. When there is strong bonding, then negative or positive suggestions don’t matter. It’s only when the bonding is not very strong that negative suggestions call for rebelliousness in the mind.
"
"Q: 

 How do you bring peace to a relationship with a lot of conflict and arguments?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 There are two ways to handle it:  · Move away from that place at that time - because when everybody is angry and things are heating up, everyone goes deaf. Angry people do not listen to anyone. The best thing is move away a little bit and wait for things to cool down.  · Be there, with patience - First agree with the person, say, ""Yes, I agree with you"".  Suppose your partner is arguing with you, don’t say, ""No, you are wrong"". Instead say, ""Yes, you are right, I agree with you"". The moment you agree, the temperature comes down. As the temperature comes down, say, ""But…"". This is the secret. Sometimes people come to me with big ideas. I tell them, ""Your idea is brilliant, very good, but it is impractical"". Use your skill to calm the situation, and then get across what you want to the other person.

 How to deal with my child asking too many questions?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Children ask questions and often they are not looking for an answer, they move on whether you answer or not. Children are not stuck in questions like adults. Adults get stuck in questions, and ask the same questions ten times; children don't care. The spirit of inquiry comes to their mind, they ask a question and move on. So, you shouldn't take it too seriously.
"
"Q: 

 What is Love?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 If there is one substances by which everything is held together and you want to give it a name, you can call it love. It is the basis of all existence. All the cells in your body love each other, that is why they are together. The day they stop loving each other, it all disintegrates.   Love is not all wiggly wiggly and mushy mushy, ""Oh I can’t live without you, I love you so much"", and so on. It is not that. That is just an emotional something. Love means (silence)… that is it.  Love is indescribable. You can’t describe it. And there is not a creature on this planet which doesn’t know it. From the sea to the fishes, from a chicken to an enlightened person, everybody has experienced love. Love for life is what we think it is, but life itself is love. So see through this knowledge that this whole universe is love.

 How does one decide to end a relationship especially when children are involved. We are not able to see eye to eye with each other although I do not hate my spouse. Should I change my view using knowledge and carry on with my life?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
At times of conflict you don’t see eye to eye with each other, this happens. Have patience. When it becomes absolutely impossible you will not even ask a question. The fact that you’re asking whether you should continue or not indicates that you should continue. It means you can still expand and accommodate.
"
"Q: 

 Gurudev, how can I know whether what I am experiencing is because of my Karmas from my past lives, or is it because of my actions in the present life?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Whether the action is from a past life, or something done 10 years back, or done just yesterday, or even 10 minutes back – it really does not matter. Ultimately, all Karma is Karma, that’s it. That is why it is said that the ways of Karma are mysterious and unfathomable. One cannot understand it totally. That is why we say that you should not worry much about Karma. Just keep moving ahead.
"
"Q: 

 Can you please speak about the palm leaf Nadi reading?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 In ancient India, the Rishisused to have universities in which they used to train psychics. Psychic meansthe one who can see into the future. So, people would stay for twelve or thirteen years, meditate, go deep within and then the master would give them a task. He would say, ""In 2015, on this particular day, at this particular minute, somebody will be born. Astrologically, you calculate and predict how their life will be."" It involved two things – astrological calculation and an insight into space and time. So, this is what they used to do. However, since this was written by the students, it need not be hundred percent true. Students can make mistakes. They will be seventy to eighty percent correct. Second thing is that they can only give you a possibility, saying this may happen. If you are a meditator and if you are on the path of spiritual knowledge, you keep changing your destiny, since you are bringing more positivity into your life. If you chant, meditate and do pranayama, your freedom increases and you don't feel bound by certain events of life.

"Q: 

 Gurudev, how do I forgive those who have abused me emotionally and physically? Sometimes I feel like killing them but even that doesn’t seem enough.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
When you get hurt, it is not only the other person at fault, it is also your ignorance and your naivety. You have not been intelligent enough, or intuitive enough to avoid it, or move out of it. So, take a little bit of the responsibility on yourself as well. If you had been strong and skillful, nobody could have abused you. When you see the situation from this perspective, you will become calmer.    I want to ask you, haven’t you caused some pain or hurt to someone else knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly? You have. If others hold on to it for a lifetime and go after you, how would you like it?    My dear, if someone has abused you, they have been ignorant. It is because of ignorance and some hurt inside them, that they have caused it to others. See it from a wider lens. A happy person will not come and harm anyone else. If someone is harming others, it is because they are not happy, not centered and they don’t know what you know. Consider them as sick people. If someone is physically sick, do you get angry at them? These people are mentally and emotionally sick, they are spiritually sick, and if you hold a grudge against them, you will also become one among them. You will get sick. For your own sake, you should let go and move on.
"
"Q: 

 Why is someone aggressive towards someone else? What is the reason for that?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Stress. Someone who is relaxed cannot be aggressive. Sleep does not provide you that deep mental rest. Sleep only gives you physical rest. If you are agitated and you go to sleep, then even when you wake up you feel the agitation, but meditation removes that agitation. That is why even a little bit of meditation can uplift the spirit.

 I can forgive, but I cannot forget the hurt my partner has caused me. What to do?

It's very difficult, isn't it! When you are in love with somebody, pain happens. They are not responsible for your pain, you simply feel pain. Just look at them, what can they do? They cannot behave in a different way.. But your expectations are more, so naturally all this pain comes. And because pain is not likable to anybody, you start hating the person.  If you are wise, you will see that they are just an instrument, that's all. You have to walk your path. Before you met them, you had a life. And afterwards also you will have a life. It is only the divine who will be with you forever.

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Forgiving others is not for their sake, it is for your own sake, for your mental health. Know that you have the power to do it and just do it. Open your mind to the vastness of this universe. Wake up and see that seven billion people are on this planet, everyday many are being hurt, everyday many are dying. Whatever big thing you are hanging on to about someone’s action towards you, know that it is your karma that made them act that way with you. If not that person, some other person would have given you the same experience. This is what you need to realize, this is what you need to see. When you get a nasty email, you don’t throw your computer or laptop because you’ve got a nasty email. Whatever email came, the laptop just reflects that. Similarly, people are like laptops. You don’t need to forgive them, you simply need to have a better understanding. If you ask them, sometimes, they also may not know why they behaved that way, why they did acts that hurt you. Look at life from a bigger perspective. That’s why I keep saying, behind every event there is knowledge, behind every person there is love, behind every object there is infinity, just know this, watch this, get this, that’s it.

"Q: 

 If the whole existence is one then do we have a joint account of karma?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Yes, there are so many types of karma.  1. Collective karma  2. Karma of the time  3. Karma of the place  4. Karma of a family  5. Karma of an individual  There is individual karma, then you have family karma - what you call DNA. Then comes the karma of a region, state and country.  Then there is karma of the time. During the time of World War II, all the people had similar karma and so all over the world there was war. At another particular time there was recession everywhere.     There are different layers of karma. That is why Lord Krishna said, ’Gahana Karmano Gatih’. You cannot fathom the depth of karma. Don't try to analyze karma. Just do your duty and move on. Keep moving ahead with love in your heart and with prayer in your heart.

But once sooji (a type of flour) is cooked, it cannot be reversed. If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.

 Meditation definitely helps you overcome grief when a close one has crossed over to other side.   See, death is a very certain thing. Nothing is more certain than death. However you have lived your life, you are going to die. Successful or unsuccessful, famous or infamous, rich or poor, healthy or sick - you are going to die. It is not only sick people who die, healthy people also die. Everyone will die one day, so death is the most certain thing. Meditation definitely helps you to overcome grief as it helps you accept this reality. You gain a broder perspective, and then you can say, ""Oh you are gone, bye for now. I will see you again in a short while.’   Not only that, but when you meditate, the vibrations reach across to them and they feel peaceful.

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Forgiving is not only difficult, it is almost impossible as long as you think that someone is a culprit. But if you see that person, whomsoever you want to forgive, not as a culprit but as a victim of situations, a victim of ignorance, or just a postman to deliver what was due to you, you don’t need to forgive them. They just simply disappear from your domain.    When a postman has delivered you a parcel, that’s it, you don’t think about the postman. You are with the parcel, whether you like it or not. You do whatever you want to do with the parcel. This is exactly the attitude you should have.  As I said the other day, when you get a nasty email, you don’t bang or throw your computer or laptop because you’ve got a nasty email. Whatever email came, the laptop just reflects that. That’s all!

Take small steps towards the Truth; towards this inquiry into life – “What is the goal of life?” This very inquiry can take you far. Everything has some significance in life. Just eating alone is not the goal of life. Yet eating is essential for sustaining life. Isn’t it? Similarly, sleeping is not the goal of life. But can you discard sleep altogether? No, you cannot. In the same way, you have to be happy and you also have to make others happy. This is the journey towards the Ultimate. What is the ultimate Truth, or the ultimate purpose of life?

When you find a person to be a culprit, try to see them from a broader angle. The person is a culprit because he is a victim himself or herself. He or she doesn't have knowledge, they are ignorant and they have pain in their own heart. They are a victim and so they are inflicting pain on you and others. So have compassion for them.  When you see that inside every culprit, there is a victim crying for help, you will be able to forgive them.  You must visit a prison and talk to the prisoners there, you will feel so much compassion for them. You will forgive all the sins that they have done. These poor people had nobody to guide them. No guidance and no love, and so they did all the wrong things that they did.

You may feel sorrow, you may feel some emotions come up and tears well up. Don’t judge them at that time, just be with it. If it becomes a little too unbearable then take some long deep breaths.

There are two types of thinking, one is spherical thinking and other is linear thinking. The world has neither a beginning nor an end, this is spherical thinking and this is what the Vedic concept is. The Vedic understand is that three things are eternal: The universe, Divinity and Life.

 I feel jealous when I see people who were at the same level as me earlier but are now much ahead of me. How to deal with it?

 Be friendly with those who are progressing and who are happy, and have compassion for those who are unhappy. Don't be friendly with people who are complaining and negative in their mindset because if you are friendly with them you also get into that mode. So, for people who are miserable, have compassion.    If your friend is progressing why should you be jealous? Would you like your friends being jealous of your progress? Just ask this one question to yourself.    I want to tell you an incident: once a boy was very unhappy and his parents brought him to me. This boy always used to get medals in sports but this time he lost to his friend. So I asked him this simple question, “Why are you unhappy?” He said, “I didn't get the prize”. I asked, “Who got it”, to which he said that his friend got it. I said, “That means you are unhappy that your friend got the prize"", that suddenly woke him up. I said, “What do you want? You want your friends to be happy when you win or you want your friends to be unhappy when you win?” He said, “I want my friends to be happy if I win the race”. I said, “So, now that your friend has won the race why are you not happy?” There was a sudden shift in the mindset of that boy.   This is what is happening in this world - we don't reflect on our self and that little awareness makes it all so different and changes the whole scenario.

"Q: 

 Do you need to set an alarm to come out of meditation?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
No, usually not because it can be too jarring. But if you keep an intention that I will meditate for 20 minutes or half an hour then your eyes will open. You have an inbuilt clock inside that works with your intention. Have you tried the inner mechanism?  For meditation, it is best to sit for 20 minutes in the very beginning, and not longer than that. If you meditation more than that, then when you come out of meditation you will forget where your home is and where your car keys are! So I recommend 20 minutes or half an hour in the beginning, not more.

 Please talk on the origin of life.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
When we think linearly, we think something should start somewhere and end somewhere. But we should think spherically.   Can you tell me where is the beginning point of a tennis ball? No! So when you can’t find the beginning point of a tennis ball, why do you try to find the beginning of this universe? The mathematics is wrong.  There are two types of thinking, one is spherical thinking and other is linear thinking. The world has neither a beginning nor an end, this is spherical thinking and this is what the Vedic concept is. The Vedic understand is that three things are eternal: The universe, Divinity and Life. They have no beginning and no end, they just go in cycles. This is the most interesting and most scientific understanding of the universe.

"Q: 

 Gurudev, how can I know whether what I am experiencing is because of my Karmas from my past lives, or is it because of my actions in the present life?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Whether the action is from a past life, or something done 10 years back, or done just yesterday, or even 10 minutes back – it really does not matter. Ultimately, all Karma is Karma, that’s it. That is why it is said that the ways of Karma are mysterious and unfathomable. One cannot understand it totally. That is why we say that you should not worry much about Karma. Just keep moving ahead.

"Q: 

 Is celibacy the middle path? How do we get to know of God’s expression in its totality without the feminine-masculine principle?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 See, you are made up of both, feminine and masculine. Both aspects are in you. Now, celibacy is not the only way. It is not a practice. Celibacy is something that happens when you realize that you are not the body, and the genders masculine and feminine are only for the body and not for the consciousness. The consciousness is beyond.   When you realize this consciousness is beyond, then you go beyond the gross pleasure. At some point of time you will say, ""Enough is enough. I want to just go inside"". That is when the mind turns inward. So you should not negate anything, but when the energy in you rises up, then you will naturally move towards a joy that is free from feverishness and excitement.     It is said, one minute of samadhi (experience of meditation) is equivalent to 1000 units of sex. How much joy you get in one unit of sex, a thousand units of sex is one samadhi. And that one minute of samadhi is equivalent to a billion years of rest.     Do you want that? Then you have to go beyond these regular things. See, you have to give up something to get something. If you want to really enjoy a nice good meal, you have to give up eating junk food all day. If you are stuffing yourself with a bag of potato chips from the morning, you can’t enjoy your lunch because you won’t have the appetite for it, right? When you are hungry, then you are able to enjoy a good meal.

 How to overcome feelings of guilt?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 It is simple - listen to some knowledge. Pranayama and meditation are also one of the best ways to get rid of guilt. When you meditate it removes guilt, uplifts the energy and brings a change at a very concrete level.    In Christianity, confession is given a lot of importance. You confess to the priest of the wrong that you have done. When you offer all the wrongs that you have done, you leave it to the divine to take care of it.  In the Hindu and Buddhist tradition, people do ‘Kshama prardhana’, which means asking God for forgiveness. You say, ""Knowingly and unknowingly I have done some wrong, please forgive me"". Asking for forgiveness will take you out of guilt.

"Q: 

 Can you please speak about the palm leaf Nadi reading?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 In ancient India, the Rishisused to have universities in which they used to train psychics. Psychic meansthe one who can see into the future. So, people would stay for twelve or thirteen years, meditate, go deep within and then the master would give them a task. He would say, ""In 2015, on this particular day, at this particular minute, somebody will be born. Astrologically, you calculate and predict how their life will be."" It involved two things – astrological calculation and an insight into space and time. So, this is what they used to do. However, since this was written by the students, it need not be hundred percent true. Students can make mistakes. They will be seventy to eighty percent correct. Second thing is that they can only give you a possibility, saying this may happen. If you are a meditator and if you are on the path of spiritual knowledge, you keep changing your destiny, since you are bringing more positivity into your life. If you chant, meditate and do pranayama, your freedom increases and you don't feel bound by certain events of life.

 How to forgive?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
When you find a person to be a culprit, try to see them from a broader angle. The person is a culprit because he is a victim himself or herself. He or she doesn't have knowledge, they are ignorant and they have pain in their own heart. They are a victim and so they are inflicting pain on you and others. So have compassion for them.  When you see that inside every culprit, there is a victim crying for help, you will be able to forgive them.  You must visit a prison and talk to the prisoners there, you will feel so much compassion for them. You will forgive all the sins that they have done. These poor people had nobody to guide them. No guidance and no love, and so they did all the wrong things that they did.
"

 What is the use of Astrology?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Astrology only points the direction for you. In astrology, they will tell you - you may come across these problems, so take precaution. It is like a doctor who says, ""You have high cholesterol, you should take care and work out"". Similarly, if you have diabetes, you should be careful. So, their predictions are according to what medical problem you have and then they give you some remedies – if you do these things, you will have no problem. In the same way, astrologers also say, ""Oh, you are going to have Jupiter coming into the eighth house and so your mind will go topsy turvy. All the faith will go. You will have no confidence in yourself, no faith in anybody, no faith in the work you do and you will be worried. This will continue for one whole year, but it will be too much during these four to five months. So, do your meditation, pranayama, prayers regularly and you can pass that stage. Also, don’t take any decision at this time."" So, these are little predictions about the tendency of the mind and how it goes.

 What is prarabdha karma and sanchita karma?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Some karma can be changed and some cannot. When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted. But once sooji (a type of flour) is cooked, it cannot be reversed. If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk. Prarabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices.
"
"Q: 

 I feel like I have failed in everything. How do I deal with so much failure?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Never think that you fail in everything. You failed basically because your thought process failed. Thought process fails because of over ambition. When you are too feverish or too ambitious then right thoughts don’t cross your mind. Negativity also does not bring intuitive thought. So when you meditate, then your thoughts become positive and more intuitive. There is a proverb in Sanskrit which says that success comes because of thesattvaand the harmony inside you, not because of the amenities or weapons you have.At least don’t lose your smile. By losing your smile, you will become a double failure. One failure has happened, never mind. At least don’t lose the smile which is your nature.
"
"Q: 

 Gurudev, when we chant a mantra continuously, will that mantra effect our body and life ?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Definitely! But we should not keep chanting continuously, this is not correct. Do you keep bathing continuously? When you chant the mantra for some time, your mind will become stronger. That is why it called mantra. We can do it for 20 - 30 min. If you keep doing it continuously, your intellect will become dull. We should not do it too much. If you stay a lot in water, you will become a fish (laughter). That is why it is referred as mantra-snaan (bath).  If someone keeps listening to music, his intellect will stop working. Similarly, someone who keeps doing math and never listens to music, his personality will also be unbalanced. These things are there to balance our left brain and right brain. We should look it from a scientific perspective. From a scientific perspective, we should listen to music for some time, we engage in some discussions for some time, and we should think for some time. Afterwards, you will experience an all-round development.

 I can forgive, but I cannot forget the hurt my partner has caused me. What to do?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
It's very difficult, isn't it! When you are in love with somebody, pain happens. They are not responsible for your pain, you simply feel pain. Just look at them, what can they do? They cannot behave in a different way.. But your expectations are more, so naturally all this pain comes. And because pain is not likable to anybody, you start hating the person.  If you are wise, you will see that they are just an instrument, that's all. You have to walk your path. Before you met them, you had a life. And afterwards also you will have a life. It is only the divine who will be with you forever.

 Why do we have guilt?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
It is good to have a little bit of guilt, not too much. That little guilt can prevent you from committing the same mistake again.    What is guilt? Intellectually you know an action to be bad, but you have a temptation to do that action because it promises you some pleasure or joy. Your hearts wants something, but the mind says, 'It is wrong'. Between the mind and the heart, the heart wins most of the time and this is when guilt comes up in you. And little bit of that guilt can prevent you from derailing further, but it should not be too much.

 Does meditation help to come out of the grief when a closed one passes away?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Meditation definitely helps you overcome grief when a close one has crossed over to other side.   See, death is a very certain thing. Nothing is more certain than death. However you have lived your life, you are going to die. Successful or unsuccessful, famous or infamous, rich or poor, healthy or sick - you are going to die. It is not only sick people who die, healthy people also die. Everyone will die one day, so death is the most certain thing. Meditation definitely helps you to overcome grief as it helps you accept this reality. You gain a broder perspective, and then you can say, ""Oh you are gone, bye for now. I will see you again in a short while.’   Not only that, but when you meditate, the vibrations reach across to them and they feel peaceful.
"
"Q: 

 Can you say something about karma and freedom?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Life moves by dual (two) factors:  1) Inner Tendencies and  2) Outer Influences  Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behaviour, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors - the tendencies from within and influences from outside can either be beneficial or harmful.  It is awareness (viveka) that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyaana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.  It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising one’s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny. Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.

"Q: 

 If the whole existence is one then do we have a joint account of karma?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Yes, there are so many types of karma.  1. Collective karma  2. Karma of the time  3. Karma of the place  4. Karma of a family  5. Karma of an individual  There is individual karma, then you have family karma - what you call DNA. Then comes the karma of a region, state and country.  Then there is karma of the time. During the time of World War II, all the people had similar karma and so all over the world there was war. At another particular time there was recession everywhere.     There are different layers of karma. That is why Lord Krishna said, ’Gahana Karmano Gatih’. You cannot fathom the depth of karma. Don't try to analyze karma. Just do your duty and move on. Keep moving ahead with love in your heart and with prayer in your heart.

 Is meditation concentration?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Meditation is not concentration. Meditation is a deep relaxation, and it is happening to us many times but we don't realize it. Little meditations have happened to all of us here and there, now and then when we felt some happiness. Every time you felt a deep sense of happiness, fulfillment or satisfaction, know that you have somewhere touched that level of meditation.

If you really want them to change, you have to wish for their welfare – because what they are doing is not good for them. If that is your intention, they will change. Your every prayer will make them see things differently and behave differently. So, it all lies in your intention

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
 Let us take dispassion to mean contentment. Whenever you are content, that is dispassion. If you have had a full meal, and someone brings more food, you will say, ""No I am full"", that is dispassion. You cannot exist without vairagya. Just as you breathe in, at some point, you have to breathe out. Breathing in is raga, passion, and breathing out is vairagya, dispassion. Breathing in is passion and breathing out is dispassion, and both are essential in life.

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
When you get hurt, it is not only the other person at fault, it is also your ignorance and your naivety. You have not been intelligent enough, or intuitive enough to avoid it, or move out of it. So, take a little bit of the responsibility on yourself as well. If you had been strong and skillful, nobody could have abused you. When you see the situation from this perspective, you will become calmer.    I want to ask you, haven’t you caused some pain or hurt to someone else knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly? You have. If others hold on to it for a lifetime and go after you, how would you like it?    My dear, if someone has abused you, they have been ignorant. It is because of ignorance and some hurt inside them, that they have caused it to others. See it from a wider lens. A happy person will not come and harm anyone else. If someone is harming others, it is because they are not happy, not centered and they don’t know what you know. Consider them as sick people. If someone is physically sick, do you get angry at them? These people are mentally and emotionally sick, they are spiritually sick, and if you hold a grudge against them, you will also become one among them. You will get sick. For your own sake, you should let go and move on.

 Gurudev, can wisdom happen instantly? Is it the same with enlightenment?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Yes, it can be gradual also! The other day, someone was telling me, “Gurudev, suddenly, I realized that I am happy all the time now, which I never was before!” A sudden realization comes that gradually you have become more and more happy. One day you find yourself saying, “I am so happy, so centered; nothing can shake me, nothing can take my smile away!” And then you are there!  Sometimes, there is a flash of lightning, and suddenly you see things, and then it disappears. Sometimes it is like when the sun rises, dawn comes first, then gradually darkness disappears, and day dawns very gradually, and that stays! So both phenomena are there. For some, it can come as an electrical transformation, for others it could be a gradual change. Sometimes you don’t even notice it, but one day, you say, “Wow! Aho!” Just like what is said in Ashtavakra, “Aho! Yes, I got it!”

Absolutely important to meditate! When you meditate, you have a healthy body and mind, your intellect becomes sharp and memory becomes very strong.  India’s meditation has been taken up by so many universities abroad - Stanford, Oxford, Harvard. Do you know that now they call pulling the ears super brain yoga? When you meditate daily for some time, circulation in the head and the brain improves, and even the grey matter increases. A lot of research has been done recently which states that meditation is very important. Not only does stress get eliminated, but the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) also increases.

"Q: 

 Q.Gurudev, why do we have to suffer because of our past impressions? In the present we are innocent.
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
Until the impression of your previous done karma is there on your mind, that karma manages to exist. That impression can only be erased through meditation, pranayama and service. You are freed from karma once the impression is erased.  All this is on the mind level only. Karma is nothing but an impression on the mind. When you wake up and see that the mind is a part of you but you are not your mind (that you are much greater than your mind), then all karma automatically dissolves.
"
"Q: 

 Can you please enlighten us with the concept of karma? Where can we read more about this in depth?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
The real meaning of is Karma is Action. Action can be classified into three: The past, present and future.  The past actions are impressions, the future actions are also impressions and present actions is Karma that is giving you result now. So, Karma means the impression of the past, which will draw similar situations in the future and that is the future Karma. And present action what you are doing is creating an impression in your mind and that is again called Karma.  I will give you a simple example. How many of you have the habit of drinking coffee first thing in the morning? How many of you get a headache when you don’t drink coffee? (Many raise their hands) This is coffee Karma. Because you have been drinking coffee, it has made certain impressions in the consciousness, and if one day you don’t drink coffee, you get a headache. That is coffee Karma.

"Q: 

 Dear Gurudev, what is the main mantra or key to happiness in life?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
The key to happiness in life is to not stay stuck in 'I…Me…Mine' (meaning one’s own personal desires or material gains). Dedicate your life to some larger goal, or to the service of others around you. Then you will find that only happiness flows through your life.
The second thing you need to remember at all times is this, 'There is someone (the Divine) who loves me very dearly, and is taking care of me at all times. He cannot be without me and He is all capable of removing any lack that I have'.Knowing this too brings such joy in one’s life.
See, when it comes to doing things in life, you cannot possibly go on doing something or the other all your life. Also, you cannot do something which is beyond your capabilities. So all your actions are limited by your capabilities and by time. For example, a new-born child is not able to do many things by himself until he becomes 5-10 years of age. Until then he is dependent on others for many of his needs. In the same way, when we grow old and become 70-80 years of age, we find that there is very little that we can do on our own. We again become dependent on others around us.
This intermediate time in our lives is when we are capable of doing something. And in that time period too, we will still be able to do only as much as our capabilities allow us to do
The same person cannot become a doctor and an engineer and a bureaucrat all together at once. He can only become of these three. So everyone has different capabilities, and the limitations that time places on each person are different (meaning depending on the age of a person).
Everyone has different strengths. There is a limit to our capability also. You will not be able to do something today, as well as you could do it 10 years ago when you were younger, isn’t it so?
What you are doing now, is something you will not be able to do so well, after 20 years from now. So we are dependent on both time and our capabilities.
But when we remember this – that there is a Supreme power which belongs to us so totally, which is capable of fulfilling all our needs and wishes, and which is with us at all times – then this strong faith alone can keep us happy at all times. It does not matter what you call this Supreme power, whether you call it the Guru Shakti, or the Paramatma (supreme soul or Consciousness), or God. When you have this faith in you, then you can be happy at all times; regardless of your capabilities. Then you will not feel weak and insecure in your old age also because you know that there is someone who is all-powerful who is taking care of you and protecting you at all times.So just having this faith alone can make us so happy.
As age progresses, our strengths and capabilities diminish. This is natural.
You see many people, as they grow old they become so dejected and insecure. Their face reflects only misery and sorrow. The older they get the more miserable they become. But a devotee is not like this at all. For a devotee, the older he gets, the more joyful and happy he becomes. He smiles more and more, and is happy at all times. 
A devotee thinks, 'Oh, I have seen it all. I have known and understood it all. I am happy and content from within. And God is there with me at all times to fulfil all of my needs'.So with this deep feeling of faith, a devotee will remain happy at all times. This is something we all must remember.
Once, I had gone to South Africa and the people from an Old Age Home there came to visit me. Huge crowds of people gathered there to meet me. I felt so disappointed looking at their faces. I just kept wondering what had happened to them. They looked so miserable.
Their children had thrown them out of their own homes and put them in an Old Age home. They became so depressed thinking about their children that it showed on their faces. It looked as if they hadn’t smiled in ages. 
I met our Art of Living teachers there and told them, 'Make these people attend The Happiness Program. Teach them to do sadhana and bring them on the path of knowledge'.
After a certain age, one finds it very difficult to learn something new. Why is this? It is because as we grow old, our sight and hearing start to diminish gradually. 
Even if we are able to see or hear things, the mind is not able to grasp and understand what we have seen or heard. Then even if we listen to some knowledge, it remains at the external level only, it does not sink deep within. Such is the state of a person in old age.
So I told the other people, 'Just see what happens in old age. So keep your life dedicated to some greater goal and be in knowledge. Do not get caught up in attachment and desires, thinking only about your children, or your home, etc.'
One can hardly imagine what difficulties those people must have gone through in their lives. How they must have earned money to raise and educate their children, and after all that, the same children brought them to an old age home and paid some money for their parents to be looked after. Once in a year they visit their parents, or write a letter to them if they cannot come to meet them; like during Mother’s Day, or Father’s Day, etc. The fate of those poor old parents is really very unfortunate.
But when we have this unshakable faith that there is a Supreme Power with me at all times which loves me dearly and belongs to me, and will never leave me; then the strength we get from such a faith makes us glow with happiness, and our face lights up with a smile that never fades. This is why Spirituality is very essential in life. It is spirituality that brings happiness, enthusiasm, intuition, self-realization and the fulfillment of all that one wishes.

"Q: 

 Gurudev, what is the Atma (soul)?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
It is the cause behind your very existence. Without it, you would not exist. The Atma is that which listens through the ears, perceives through the eyes, smells through the nose, tastes through the tongue, and which is the reason for everything that happens.

"Q: 

 Gurudev, how much money should a person earn in life? Does earning more than one’s needs mean hoarding of money that is someone else’s share?Also, what is the difference between being resourceful and self-sufficient?
","
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar:
See, put in all your efforts and earn as much as you can. But follow certain rules. It is not right to earn money by committing crimes, or through any other wrong means.If you do, then the result will only be misery and suffering. If you adopt wrong means to earn money, then your own conscience will prick you from within, and you will feel, 'I have stolen from someone'. It will pinch you from within.
So do not use wrong means of earning money. You should put in all your effort to earn money, making the best use of time available to you.
